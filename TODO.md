##TODO:
7 Things left to do in this phase

##Phase 1:
The developing phase, Schrottii's phase, the essential features of the game

- Overworld quests
- More Animated UI
- Equipment system:
Weapon slots (LHand/RHand), Armor slots (Head/Body/Bottom/Hand), and accessory slots (Hand/Neck/Head).
Most equipment can be upgraded to a blacksmith with enough Bricks, up to +10.

- Cutscene mode (Overworld)
- Cutscene mode (Battle)

- The remaining scenes (formation, items, etc.)
- Different attacks, weapons, NTF summon, etc.

- World map mode (all characters/NPCs switch to their 16x16 sheets, and you can move half a tile instead of a whole tile. There's always a cloud shadow effect.)
