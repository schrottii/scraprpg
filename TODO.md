##Phase 2
The main focus of this phase is creating maps, enemies, the story, etc. - the stuff you play.
There is still some coding, some new features, but not as much as in phase 1 (Schrottii can finally rest a bit)

- Startup introduction

- Mastery Techs
- Duo Mastery Techs

- Promotion (and Evolution Tree) system
- Mastery Tokens

- Parallax/animated effects for battle backgrounds (and overworld too if possible.)
- and a dramatic sequence before battle.

- Add more of those Attack type things (Defend, Scan, etc.)


##Phase 3
The testing & publishing phase

- Test until you die
- Be proud of ourselves
- Nerf Skro 🤔
- Publish the game
