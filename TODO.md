##TODO:
10 Things left to do in this phase

##Phase 1:
The developing phase, Schrottii's phase, the essential features of the game

- Character runs (the sprite runs) when he moves toward the enemy (in battle)
- More battle sprites (like the character being hit, the character attacking, etc.)
- Slightly weaker weather effect overlay (Fog tho :deathgaze:)
- Dialogue box sliding up (at start) and sliding back down (at end.) This can work the reverse way when the dialogue box is on the top of the screen instead of the bottom.
- Battle encounter sequence improvements (Music stops, wait a split second and the infamous appearance of the mastery token swinging around while the screen floods to white)
- Intro+loop music system (other music won't use this so those music will still stick with the usual single-loop system that we have today)
- Battle action delaying (eg. After someone uses a magic or someone attacks (wether it be an enemy or a character,) the battle will wait 2/3 seconds before the next)
- Black fade after ending a battle
- Particles
- Overworld quests
- Various enemy sizes in battles

##Phase 2
The main focus of this phase is creating maps, enemies, the story, etc. - the stuff you play.
There is still some coding, some new features, but not as much as in phase 1 (Schrottii can finally rest a bit)

- Startup introduction

- Mastery Techs
- Duo Mastery Techs

- Promotion (and Evolution Tree) system
- Mastery Tokens

- Parallax/animated effects for battle backgrounds (and overworld too if possible.)
- and a dramatic sequence before battle.

- Add more of those Attack type things (Defend, Scan, etc.)
- More Animated UI (what exactly?)
- Most equipment can be upgraded by a blacksmith with enough Bricks, up to +10.


##Phase 3
The testing & publishing phase

- Test until you die
- Be proud of ourselves
- Nerf Skro 🤔
- Publish the game
