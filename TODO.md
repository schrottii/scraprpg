##TODO:
3 Things left to do in this phase
(we are not always good at counting)

##Phase 1:
The developing phase, Schrottii's phase, the essential features of the game

- More battle sprites
  - Attack 
  - Magic cast 
  - Item use 
  - Defend 
  - Others (either related to MTs or other normal actions.)
- Particles
- Overworld quests (Side quests, NOT main story objectives)
- Digital pad rework (Larger, turns invisible when idle, and uses a new set of buttons)
- MISSING BLACK FADES I CAN'T LIST IN THIS MD FILE!!!1!!1!1 (dies)

##Phase 2
The main focus of this phase is creating maps, enemies, the story, etc. - the stuff you play.
There is still some coding, some new features, but not as much as in phase 1 (Schrottii can finally rest a bit)

- Startup introduction

- Mastery Techs
- Duo Mastery Techs

- Promotion (and Evolution Tree) system
- Mastery Tokens

- Parallax/animated effects for battle backgrounds (and overworld too if possible.)
- and a dramatic sequence before battle.

- Add more of those Attack type things (Defend, Scan, etc.)
- More Animated UI (what exactly?)
- Most equipment can be upgraded by a blacksmith with enough Bricks, up to +10.


##Phase 3
The testing & publishing phase

- Test until you die
- Be proud of ourselves
- Nerf Skro 🤔
- Publish the game
