##TODO:
4+2 Things left to do in this phase
(we are not always good at counting)

##Phase 1:
The developing phase, Schrottii's phase, the essential features of the game, mostly coding (maybe a bad decision in hindsight, sigh).
Nov 2021 - Nov 2022!
IT'S DONE!

##Phase 1.5
The current phase, focus on Map Maker and preparing for the first chapter. Transition between phase 1 and 2.
Nov 2022 - (still going)

- MAP MAKER
  - Placing items
  - Dialogues
  - Teleporters
  - Copy / Paste
  
- Add the remaining settings
- Overworld quests (Side quests, NOT main story objectives)

- Finishing the story of chapter 1
- Creating tiles and their images, that we need for chapter 1

##Phase 2
The main focus of this phase is creating maps, enemies, the story, etc. - the stuff you play.
There is still some coding, some new features, but not as much as in phase 1 (Schrottii can finally rest a bit)


Coding stuff to do in phase 2:
- Startup introduction

- Mastery Techs
- Duo Mastery Techs

- Promotion (and Evolution Tree) system
- Mastery Tokens

- Parallax/animated effects for battle backgrounds (and overworld too if possible.)

- More Animated UI (what exactly?)
- Most equipment can be upgraded by a blacksmith with enough Bricks, up to +10.

- Code improvements

##Phase 3
The testing & publishing phase. This will be fun.

- Test until we all die
- Be proud of ourselves
- Nerf Skro 🤔
- Publish the game
