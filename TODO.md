## TODO:
- Monster Book: Enemy details
- Stats scene



## Phase 1:
The developing phase, Schrottii's phase, the essential features of the game, mostly coding (DEFINITELY a bad decision in hindsight, sigh).
Nov 13th 2021 - Nov 1st 2022!
IT'S DONE!

## Phase 1.5
Focus on Map Maker and preparing for the first chapter. Transition between phase 1 and 2.
Nov 1st 2022 - Nov 27th 2022!
IT'S DONE!

## Phase 2
The main focus of this phase is creating maps, enemies, the story, etc. - the stuff you play.
There is still some coding, some new features, but not as much as in phase 1 (~~Schrottii can finally rest a bit~~ nope) 
This is where the other members were meant to take over, but they failed completely.
April 2025 - August 2025!
IT'S ... done ?
