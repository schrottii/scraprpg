# ScrapRPG
A *Scrap Clicker* RPG fan game in development. **THIS GAME IS NOT AN IDLE GAME IN ANY WAY DESPITE THE GAME IT WAS BASED ON!!**

## Backstory
On November 2018, *Frank Neurhein* would make the [very first concept of the game](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/905449922634080347/1000433408536739952/scraprpg.png?width=439&height=675), however, his plans to create the game at that time was slim, and the idea faded out of obscurity. Not until four years in the future...
DecastarWasNeverACoder (More known as *Decastar*) was the second person to think of such concept of a *Scrap Clicker*-based role-playing game in February of 2021. At November of 2021, *Salveeny* (Also known as *Barduzzi* by the majority) and DecastarWasNeverACoder eventually brainstormed to create the game from conception. About a week later, *Frank Neurhein* would make his debut in the development scene as the primary programmer, marking the birth of the game's GitHub repository.
