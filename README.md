Scrap of the Round

The Second Unofficial Scrap Game!

This game is currently in very early development and progress is relatively slow due to the lack of programmers interested on programming the game, we are sorry for the inconvenience.

Anyway...

The game will contain thirteen chapters, each chapter has a protagonist who will eventually unite with the other protagonists in the tenth chapter.

The game has many stuff to tinker with and some of them have game-breaking quirks, getting them all is never straightforward however as it will take practice and dedication to get all the stuff available in the game.

The game also has many easter eggs, secrets, and community-made stuff for you to explore and find out.

Well, I hope you liked my explanation of our fangame, please help us if you are interested! We will one day make this passion project we are making a reality! Bye all!!
