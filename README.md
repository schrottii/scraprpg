# ScrapRPG
A *Scrap Clicker* RPG fan game. Despite the games it is based on, it is not an idle game. It is a full-blown RPG with maps, enemies, spells and all that stuff. But it plays in the Scrap universe and contains bits of official lore. 

The game is approved and licensed by Schrott Games / Endte, and also copyrighted (see license file). Any other Scrap RPGs are fake. 

The game used to be made by a team of almost a dozen people, and some brought music, ideas and sprites to the table. But 98% of the game was made by the Schrottii, including 99.5% of the code, most enemies, maps, polishing, etc.

## Backstory
On November 2018, *Schrottii* would make the [very first concept of the game](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/905449922634080347/1000433408536739952/scraprpg.png?width=439&height=675). However, her plans to create the game at that time was slim, and the idea faded out of obscurity. Not until four years in the future...
Decastar2819 was the second person to think of such concept of a *Scrap Clicker*-based role-playing game in February of 2021. At November of 2021, *Barduzzi* and him eventually brainstormed, forming the early ideas of the project. About a week later, *Schrottii* would make her debut in the game as the primary programmer, marking the birth of the game's GitHub repository.
Progress was fast in November of 2021, early 2022 and that year's Summer. However, when the coding phase was done, contributions from other roles were lacking. Due to inactivity and laziness of the rest of the team, past mistakes, and a toxic environment, 2023 saw almost no progress. In January of 2024, Schrottii took the project into her own hands entirely, taking the lead on every role, but progress was still heavily limited due to past experiences with the project and trauma. Thus 2024 was lacking progress too, but she still contributed more in that year than anyone else did in the entirety of phase 2.
In April and May 2025, progress reached a new level of speed, with lots of content, and some new features and improvements making it into the game. This rush was tragically stopped by an accident, but resumed in July and August. The game was then released, albeit with few maps, on August 13th, after hundreds of hours and two Summer holidays spent by Schrottii, and some casual contributions by others.
