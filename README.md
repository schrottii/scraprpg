# ScrapRPG
A *Scrap Clicker* RPG fan game in early development. **THIS GAME IS NOT AN IDLE GAME IN ANY WAY DESPITE THE GAME IT WAS BASED ON!!**
## Story
DecastarWasNeverACoder (More known as *Decastar* or *nameTheFights*) was the first person to think of such concept of a *Scrap Clicker*-based role-playing game in February of 2021. At November of 2021, *Salveeny* (Also known as *Barduzzi* by the majority) and DecastarWasNeverACoder eventually brainstormed to create the game from conception. About a week later, *Frank Neurhein* would make his debut in the development scene as the primary programmer, marking the birth of the game's GitHub repository.
