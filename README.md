# ScrapRPG
A *Scrap Clicker* RPG fan game in development. **THIS GAME IS NOT AN IDLE GAME IN ANY WAY DESPITE THE GAME IT WAS BASED ON!!**

## Backstory
On November 2018, *Schrottii* would make the [very first concept of the game](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/905449922634080347/1000433408536739952/scraprpg.png?width=439&height=675). However, her plans to create the game at that time was slim, and the idea faded out of obscurity. Not until four years in the future...
DecastarWasNeverACoder (Known more as *Decastar2819*) was the second person to think of such concept of a *Scrap Clicker*-based role-playing game in February of 2021. At November of 2021, *Salveeny* (Also known as *Barduzzi* outside of GitHub) and *Decastar2819* eventually brainstormed, forming the project as it is now. About a week later, *Schrottii* would make her debut in the game as the primary programmer, marking the birth of the game's GitHub repository.
Progress was fast in November of 2021, early 2022 and that year's Summer. However, when the coding phase was done, contributions from other roles were lacking. Due to inactivity and laziness of the rest of the team, past mistakes, and a toxic environment, 2023 saw almost no progress. In January of 2024, Schrottii took the project into her own hands entirely, taking the lead on every role, but progress was still heavily limited due to past experiences with the project and trauma.
