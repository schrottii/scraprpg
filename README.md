Scrap of the Round

The Second Unofficial Scrap Game!

This game is currently in very early development and progress is relatively slow at the moment due to the lack of programmers interested on programming the game, we are sorry for the inconvenience.

Anyway...

The game will contain twelve chapters, with one extra chapter after finishing all twelve chapters in any order, each chapter has a protagonist who will eventually unite with the other protagonists in the thirtheenth chapter.

The game has many possible endings with some of them having a different final boss, getting them all is never straightforward however as it will take practice and dedication to get all the possible endings available in the game.

The game also has many easter eggs, secrets, and community-made stuff for you to explore and find out.

Well, I hope you liked my explanation of our fangame, please help us if you are interested! We will one day make this passion project we are making a reality! Bye all!!
